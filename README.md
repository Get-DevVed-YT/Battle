God save our gracious King,<br>
Long live our noble King,<br>
God save the King!<br>
Send him victorious,<br>
Happy and glorious,<br>
Long to reign over us,<br>
God save the King!<br>

O Lord our God arise,<br>
Scatter our enemies,<br>
And make them fall!<br>
Confound their politics,<br>
Frustrate their knavish tricks,<br>
On Thee our hopes we fix,<br>
God save us all!<br>

Not in this land alone,<br>
But be God’s mercies known,<br>
From shore to shore!<br>
Lord make the nations see,<br>
That men should brothers be,<br>
And form one family,<br>
The wide world o’er.<br>

From every latent foe,<br>
From the assassins blow,<br>
God save the King!<br>
O’er his thine arm extend,<br>
For Britain’s sake defend,<br>
Our father, prince, and friend,<br>
God save the King!<br>

Thy choicest gifts in store,<br>
On him be pleased to pour,<br>
Long may he reign!<br>
May he defend our laws,<br>
And ever give us cause,<br>
To sing with heart and voice,<br>
God save the King!<br>
